This project is part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript)

In this project, I used modules to keep code, well, modular. I tried to keep the global code to a minimum while allowing the game to function.

You can choose to enter your name for each player. If you do not, it fills in default names. Also you can choose whether you want to play against another person, or with the computer. You can choose to be 'x' or 'o' against the computer. Or a 'demo mode' where you can watch 2 computers play against eachother.

The computer AI is just a random move generator. 

This game works like classic tic-tac-toe, and will alert you who wins, or if it is a tie.
